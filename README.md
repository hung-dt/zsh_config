ZSH configuration files

## Preparation
Install zsh:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zsh
zsh --version
```
Change shell:
```shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
Close the current terminal and open a new one:
```
echo $SHELL
```
or
```
echo $0
```

## Install patched fonts for dev

[nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

[powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
```
sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline
```

## zsh git-prompt

Follow this [git-prompt guide](https://joshdick.net/2017/06/08/my_git_prompt_for_zsh_revisited.html)

## Customize the terminal

### Color schemes with [Gogh](https://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/)

Before using Gogh, need to install `dconf-cli`, `uuid-runtime`:
```
sudo apt install dconf-cli uuid-runtime
```

Clone Gogh:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh
```

Install color scheme by:
```
cd Gogh/themes
./zenburn.sh #or whatever color scheme you want to use
```

For Gnome terminal you'll need to create a new Gnome Terminal profile, or else you'll get an error. From the Gnome Terminal Preferences, click the + button next to Profiles, enter a new profile name and click Create. After installing a new color scheme (which is added as a new profile for Gnome Terminal) using Gogh, you can delete this profile.

Some favorite color schemes: *Brogrammer, Panda, Shaman, Vs Code Dark+*

### Fancy prompt with [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

**Install manually:**
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>! ~/.zshrc
```

**Configuration**

On the first run, Powerlevel10k configuration wizard will ask you a few questions and configure your prompt. If it doesn't trigger automatically, type `p10k configure`. Configuration wizard creates `~/.p10k.zsh` based on your preferences. Additional prompt customization can be done by editing this file. It has plenty of comments to help you navigate through configuration options.
